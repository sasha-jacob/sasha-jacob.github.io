<p>Hey everyone, I'm Sasha Jacob, and I'm currently a first-year student at NYU, pursuing a degree in Integrated Design and Media! I'm passionate about blending creativity with technology to craft innovative and impactful solutions. As I dive deeper into my studies, I'm excited to explore various aspects of design, media, and the intersection of art and technology. Looking forward to learning, growing, and connecting with others who share similar interests and aspirations.</p>
